1] A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.
The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. The solution must minimize operational complexity.
Which solution meets these requirements

A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket. 

General line: Collect huge amount of the files across multiple continents
Conditions: High speed Internet connectivity
Task: aggregate the data from all in a single S3 bucket
Requirements: as quick as possible, minimize operational complexity

Correct answer A: S3 Transfer Acceleration because:
- ideally works with objects for long-distance transfer (uses Edge Locations)
- can speed up content transfers to and from S3 as much as 50-500%
- use cases: mobile & web application uploads and downloads, distributed office transfers, data exchange with trusted partners. Generally for sharing of large data sets between companies, customers can set up special access to their S3 buckets with accelerated uploads to speed data exchanges and the pace of innovation.
------------------------------
2]A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed.

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena at your data stored in Amazon S3 and begin using standard SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds.
------------------------------
3]A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Add the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.

aws:PrincipalOrgID – Simplifies specifying the Principal element in a resource-based policy. This global key provides an alternative to listing all the account IDs for all AWS accounts in an organization. Instead of listing all of the accounts that are members of an organization, you can specify the organization ID in the Condition element.
proposes adding the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy. This would limit access to the S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations, as the aws PrincipalOrgID condition key can check if the request is coming from within the organization.
------------------------------
4]An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet.
Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3?

A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.

Keywords:
- EC2 in VPC
- EC2 instance needs to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet
VPC endpoint allows you to connect to AWS services using a private network instead of using the public Internet.

With a gateway endpoint, you can access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC, and with no additional cost. However, gateway endpoints do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway.
------------------------------
5]A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.
What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?

C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS

Option C, which involves copying the data to Amazon EFS and modifying the application to use Amazon EFS for document storage, is the most appropriate solution to ensure users can see all their documents at once in the duplicated architecture. Amazon EFS provides scalability, availability, and shared access, allowing both EC2 instances to access and synchronize the documents seamlessly.
------------------------------
6]A company uses NFS to store large video files in on-premises network attached storage. Each video file ranges in size from 1 MB to 500 GB. The total storage is 70 TB and is no longer growing. The company decides to migrate the video files to Amazon S3. The company must migrate the video files as soon as possible while using the least possible network bandwidth.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

B. Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3

 On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.
------------------------------
7] A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages. The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability.
Which solution meets these requirements?

D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

an SQS queue can handle a maximum of 3,000 messages per second. However, you can request higher throughput by contacting AWS Support. AWS can increase the message throughput for your queue beyond the default limits in increments of 300 messages per second, up to a maximum of 10,000 messages per second.

It's important to note that the maximum number of messages per second that a queue can handle is not the same as the maximum number of requests per second that the SQS API can handle. The SQS API is designed to handle a high volume of requests per second, so it can be used to send messages to your queue at a rate that exceeds the maximum message throughput of the queue.
------------------------------8] A company is migrating a distributed application to AWS. The application serves variable workloads. The legacy platform consists of a primary server that coordinates jobs across multiple compute nodes. The company wants to modernize the application with a solution that maximizes resiliency and scalability.
How should a solutions architect design the architecture to meet these requirements?

B. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.

Option B: This option provides a decoupled architecture where the jobs are sent to an SQS queue. The compute nodes (EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group) can then process these jobs. Scaling based on the size of the SQS queue (the number of messages) allows the architecture to adapt to variable workloads, scaling out when the queue depth increases and scaling in when the depth decreases.
------------------------------
9] A company is running an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that are accessed frequently for the first few days after the files are created. After 7 days the files are rarely accessed.
The total data size is increasing and is close to the company's total storage capacity. A solutions architect must increase the company's available storage space without losing low-latency access to the most recently accessed files. The solutions architect must also provide file lifecycle management to avoid future storage issues.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

ption B: Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a hybrid cloud storage solution, integrating on-premises environments with cloud storage. Files written to the file share are automatically saved as S3 objects. With S3 Lifecycle policies, you can transition objects between storage classes. Transitioning to Glacier Deep Archive is suitable for rarely accessed files. This solution addresses both the storage capacity and lifecycle management requirements.
------------------------------
10] A company is building an ecommerce web application on AWS. The application sends information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST API to process. The company wants to ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order. Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing

11] A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon Aurora database. The EC2 instances connect to the database by using user names and passwords that are stored locally in a file. The company wants to minimize the operational overhead of credential management.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

A. Use AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation. 

AWS Secrets Manager is a secrets management service that helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources. This service enables you to rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle.
------------------------------
12] A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.

CloudFront with Multiple Origins: CloudFront allows you to set up multiple origins for your distribution, so you can use both the ALB (for dynamic content) and the S3 bucket (for static content) as origins. This means that both your dynamic and static content can be served through CloudFront, which will cache content at edge locations to reduce latency.
Route 53 Integration with CloudFront: Amazon Route 53 can be easily configured to route traffic for your domain to a CloudFront distribution. Users will access your domain, and Route 53 will direct them to the nearest CloudFront edge location.
------------------------------
13] A company performs monthly maintenance on its AWS infrastructure. During these maintenance activities, the company needs to rotate the credentials for its Amazon RDS for MySQL databases across multiple AWS Regions.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions. Configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.

AWS Secrets Manager allows you to store, manage, and rotate secrets, such as database credentials, across multiple AWS Regions. By enabling multi-Region secret replication, you can replicate the secrets across the required Regions to allow for seamless rotation of the credentials during maintenance activities. Additionally, Secrets Manager provides automatic rotation of secrets on a schedule, which would minimize the operational overhead of rotating the credentials on a monthly basis.
------------------------------
14] A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance.
The database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions. The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

C. Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.

Option C: Using Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment and configuring Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas is the most appropriate solution. Aurora is a MySQL-compatible relational database engine that provides high performance and scalability. With Multi-AZ deployment, the database is automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
Aurora Auto Scaling allows the database to automatically add or remove Aurora Replicas based on the workload, ensuring that read requests can be distributed effectively and the database can scale to meet demand. This provides both high availability and automatic scaling to handle unpredictable read workloads.
------------------------------
15] A company recently migrated to AWS and wants to implement a solution to protect the traffic that flows in and out of the production VPC. The company had an inspection server in its on-premises data center. The inspection server performed specific operations such as traffic flow inspection and traffic filtering. The company wants to have the same functionalities in the AWS Cloud.

B. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. Share the dashboards with the appropriate users and groups

using Amazon QuickSight, which is a business intelligence tool provided by AWS for data visualization and reporting. With this option, you can connect all the data sources within the data lake, including Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. You can create datasets within QuickSight that pull data from these sources.
------------------------------
17] A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

A. Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances

An IAM role is an AWS resource that allows you to delegate access to AWS resources and services. You can create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and then attach the role to the EC2 instances. This will allow the EC2 instances to access the S3 bucket and the documents stored within it.
------------------------------
18] An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.
A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket. 

B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue

Option A: By creating an Amazon SQS queue and configuring the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded, the system establishes a durable and scalable way to handle incoming image processing tasks.

Option B: Configuring the Lambda function to use the SQS queue as the invocation source allows it to retrieve messages from the queue and process them in a stateless manner. After successfully processing the image, the Lambda function can delete the message from the queue to avoid duplicate processing.
------------------------------
19] A company has a three-tier web application that is deployed on AWS. The web servers are deployed in a public subnet in a VPC. The application servers and database servers are deployed in private subnets in the same VPC. The company has deployed a third-party virtual firewall appliance from AWS Marketplace in an inspection VPC. The appliance is configured with an IP interface that can accept IP packets.
A solutions architect needs to integrate the web application with the appliance to inspect all traffic to the application before the traffic reaches the web server.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

D. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.

 Gateway Load Balancer is a new type of load balancer that operates at layer 3 of the OSI model and is built on Hyperplane, which is capable of handling several thousands of connections per second. Gateway Load Balancer endpoints are configured in spoke VPCs originating or receiving traffic from the Internet. This architecture allows you to perform inline inspection of traffic from multiple spoke VPCs in a simplified and scalable fashion while still centralizing your virtual appliances.

20] A company wants to improve its ability to clone large amounts of production data into a test environment in the same AWS Region. The data is stored in Amazon EC2 instances on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment. The software that accesses this data requires consistently high I/O performance.
A solutions architect needs to minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

D. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment

Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore (FSR) enables you to create a volume from a snapshot that is fully initialized at creation. This eliminates the latency of I/O operations on a block when it is accessed for the first time. Volumes that are created using fast snapshot restore instantly deliver all of their provisioned performance

This solution requires minimal operational overhead as it leverages fully managed services that automatically scale to meet demand.
------------------------------
22] A solutions architect is using Amazon S3 to design the storage architecture of a new digital media application. The media files must be resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Some files are accessed frequently while other files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern. The solutions architect must minimize the costs of storing and retrieving the media files.
Which storage option meets these requirements? 

B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering

Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns. It can store objects in two access tiers: the frequent access tier and the infrequent access tier. The frequent access tier is optimized for frequently accessed objects and is charged at the same rate as S3 Standard. The infrequent access tier is optimized for objects that are not accessed frequently and are charged at a lower rate than S3 Standard.

S3 Intelligent Tiering is a good choice for storing media files that are accessed frequently and infrequently in an unpredictable pattern because it automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns, minimizing storage and retrieval costs. It is also resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone because it stores objects in multiple Availability Zones within a region.
------------------------------
23] A company is storing backup files by using Amazon S3 Standard storage. The files are accessed frequently for 1 month. However, the files are not accessed after 1 month. The company must keep the files indefinitely.
Which storage solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively? 

B. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month.

Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 storage class for long-term retention of data that is rarely accessed and for which retrieval times of several hours are acceptable. It is the lowest-cost storage option in Amazon S3, making it a cost-effective choice for storing backup files that are not accessed after 1 month.

You can use an S3 Lifecycle configuration to automatically transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month. This will minimize the storage costs for the backup files that are not accessed frequently.

How should the solutions architect generate the information with the LEAST operational overhead?

B. Use Cost Explorer's granular filtering feature to perform an in-depth analysis of EC2 costs based on instance types.

------------------------------25] A company is designing an application. The application uses an AWS Lambda function to receive information through Amazon API Gateway and to store the information in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database.
During the proof-of-concept stage, the company has to increase the Lambda quotas significantly to handle the high volumes of data that the company needs to load into the database. A solutions architect must recommend a new design to improve scalability and minimize the configuration effort.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

D. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

"By dividing the functionality into two Lambda functions, one for receiving the information and the other for loading it into the database, you can independently scale and optimize each function based on their specific requirements. This approach allows for more efficient resource allocation and reduces the potential impact of high volumes of data on the overall system.
------------------------------26] A company needs to review its AWS Cloud deployment to ensure that its Amazon S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

A. Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules.

You can use AWS Config to monitor and record changes to the configuration of your Amazon S3 buckets. By turning on AWS Config and enabling the appropriate rules, you can ensure that your S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.
------------------------------27] A company is launching a new application and will display application metrics on an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard. The company's product manager needs to access this dashboard periodically. The product manager does not have an AWS account. A solutions architect must provide access to the product manager by following the principle of least privilege.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Share the dashboard from the CloudWatch console. Enter the product manager's email address, and complete the sharing steps. Provide a shareable link for the dashboard to the product manage.
Share a single dashboard and designate specific email addresses of the people who can view the dashboard. Each of these users creates their own password that they must enter to view the dashboard.
------------------------------
28] A company is migrating applications to AWS. The applications are deployed in different accounts. The company manages the accounts centrally by using AWS Organizations. The company's security team needs a single sign-on (SSO) solution across all the company's accounts. The company must continue managing the users and groups in its on-premises self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

------------------------------33] A company runs an online marketplace web application on AWS. The application serves hundreds of thousands of users during peak hours. The company needs a scalable, near-real-time solution to share the details of millions of financial transactions with several other internal applications. Transactions also need to be processed to remove sensitive data before being stored in a document database for low-latency retrieval.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

C. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every transaction and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream. 

1. Real-time Data Stream: To share millions of financial transactions with other apps, you need to be able to ingest data in real-time, which is made possible by Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.

2. Data Transformation: You can cleanse and eliminate sensitive data from transactions before storing them in Amazon DynamoDB by utilizing AWS Lambda with Kinesis Data Streams. This takes care of the requirement to handle sensitive data with care.
3. Scalability: DynamoDB and Amazon Kinesis are both extremely scalable technologies that can manage enormous data volumes and adjust to the workload.
To host a static website on Amazon S3, you would first need to create an S3 bucket. Then, you would need to upload the website files to the bucket. Once the files are uploaded, you can configure the bucket to serve as a website.
------------------------------
34] A company hosts its multi-tier applications on AWS. For compliance, governance, auditing, and security, the company must track configuration changes on its AWS resources and record a history of API calls made to these resources.

D. Enable AWS Shield Advanced and assign the ELB to it.

AWS Shield Advanced provides expanded DDoS attack protection for your Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, CloudFront distributions, Route 53 hosted zones, and AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerators.
------------------------------37] A company recently launched a variety of new workloads on Amazon EC2 instances in its AWS account. The company needs to create a strategy to access and administer the instances remotely and securely. The company needs to implement a repeatable process that works with native AWS services and follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

B. Attach the appropriate IAM role to each existing instance and new instance. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish a remote SSH session.

With AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, you can manage your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs). You can use either an interactive one-click browser-based shell or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). It provides secure and auditable node management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.
------------------------------
38] A company is hosting a static website on Amazon S3 and is using Amazon Route 53 for DNS. The website is experiencing increased demand from around the world. The company must decrease latency for users who access the website.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the CloudFront distribution

Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that distributes content globally to reduce latency. By setting up a CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket hosting the static website, you can take advantage of its edge locations around the world to deliver content from the nearest location to the users, reducing the latency they experience.

CloudFront automatically caches and replicates content to its edge locations, resulting in faster delivery and lower latency for users worldwide. This solution is highly effective in optimizing performance while keeping costs under control because CloudFront charges are based on actual data transfer and requests, and the pay-as-you-go pricing model ensures that you only pay for what you use.

39] A company maintains a searchable repository of items on its website. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table that contains more than 10 million rows. The database has 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage. There are millions of updates against this data every day through the company's website.
The company has noticed that some insert operations are taking 10 seconds or longer. The company has determined that the database storage performance is the problem.
Which solution addresses this performance issue?

A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD.

Using Amazon Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD storage is the best way to solve the performance issue of insert operations taking 10 seconds or longer on an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table with more than 10 million rows and 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage.

A high-performance storage solution with reliable throughput and minimal latency is PIOPS SSD storage. Workloads like insert operations, which demand high I/O performance, are ideally suited for it.

40] A company has thousands of edge devices that collectively generate 1 TB of status alerts each day. Each alert is approximately 2 KB in size. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to ingest and store the alerts for future analysis.
The company wants a highly available solution. However, the company needs to minimize costs and does not want to manage additional infrastructure. Additionally, the company wants to keep 14 days of data available for immediate analysis and archive any data older than 14 days.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that can capture, transform, and deliver streaming data into storage systems or analytics tools, making it an ideal solution for ingesting and storing status alerts. In this solution, the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream ingests the alerts and delivers them to an S3 bucket, which is a cost-effective storage solution. An S3 Lifecycle configuration is set up to transition the data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days to minimize storage costs.
------------------------------
41] A company's application integrates with multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources for data collection. The company runs Amazon EC2 instances to receive the data and to upload the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for analysis. The same EC2 instance that receives and uploads the data also sends a notification to the user when an upload is complete. The company has noticed slow application performance and wants to improve the performance as much as possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?	

B. Create an Amazon AppFlow flow to transfer data between each SaaS source and the S3 bucket. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

Amazon AppFlow is a fully-managed integration service that enables you to securely exchange data between software as a service (SaaS) applications, such as Salesforce, and AWS services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Redshift.
The use of Appflow helps to remove the ec2 as the middle layer which slows down the process of data transmission and introduce an additional variable.
Appflow is also a fully managed AWS service, thus reducing the operational overhead.
------------------------------
42] A company runs a highly available image-processing application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single VPC. The EC2 instances run inside several subnets across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances do not communicate with each other. However, the EC2 instances download images from Amazon S3 and upload images to Amazon S3 through a single NAT gateway. The company is concerned about data transfer charges.
What is the MOST cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges?

C. Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3.

S3 VPC endpoint provides a way for an S3 request to be routed through to the Amazon S3 service, without having to connect a subnet to an internet gateway. The S3 VPC endpoint is what's known as a gateway endpoint.
------------------------------
43] A company has an on-premises application that generates a large amount of time-sensitive data that is backed up to Amazon S3. The application has grown and there are user complaints about internet bandwidth limitations. A solutions architect needs to design a long-term solution that allows for both timely backups to Amazon S3 and with minimal impact on internet connectivity for internal users.
Which solution meets these requirements?

B. Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.

AWS Direct Connect is a network service that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public Internet and can provide more reliable, lower-latency communication between your on-premises application and Amazon S3. By directing backup traffic through the AWS Direct Connect connection, you can minimize the impact on your internet bandwidth and ensure timely backups to S3.
------------------------------
44] A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains critical data. The company must protect the data from accidental deletion.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket
B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket

The two most effective steps a solutions architect can take to protect an Amazon S3 bucket from accidental deletion are:

A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket.

Versioning keeps multiple versions of objects in the S3 bucket, even when they are overwritten or deleted. This allows you to recover objects that have been accidentally deleted.

MFA Delete requires you to enter a one-time password from a multi-factor authentication (MFA) device before you can delete an object in the S3 bucket. This helps to prevent accidental deletions.
------------------------------
45] A company has a data ingestion workflow that consists of the following:
• An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for notifications about new data deliveries
• An AWS Lambda function to process the data and record metadata
The company observes that the ingestion workflow fails occasionally because of network connectivity issues. When such a failure occurs, the Lambda function does not ingest the corresponding data unless the company manually reruns the job.
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future? (Choose two.)

B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.
E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic. This will decouple the ingestion workflow and provide a buffer to temporarily store the data in case of network connectivity issues.

E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. This will allow the Lambda function to process the data from the SQS queue at its own pace, decoupling the data ingestion from the data delivery and providing more flexibility and fault tolerance.
------------------------------
46] A company has an application that provides marketing services to stores. The services are based on previous purchases by store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to generate new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in size.
Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have uploaded files that contain personally identifiable information (PII) that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate remediation.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

B. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.

Some quotas can be increased, while others cannot. To request an increase to a quota, use the Service Quotas console. To learn how to request an increase, see Requesting a quota increase in the Service Quotas User Guide. If a quota isn't available on the Service Quotas console, use the service limit increase form on the AWS Support Center Console to request an increase to the quota.
------------------------------
47] A company needs guaranteed Amazon EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones in a specific AWS Region for an upcoming event that will last 1 week.
What should the company do to guarantee the EC2 capacity?

D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

An On-Demand Capacity Reservation is a type of Amazon EC2 reservation that enables you to create and manage reserved capacity on Amazon EC2. With an On-Demand Capacity Reservation, you can specify the Region and Availability Zones where you want to reserve capacity, and the number of EC2 instances you want to reserve. This allows you to guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones in a specific Region.
------------------------------
48] A company's website uses an Amazon EC2 instance store for its catalog of items. The company wants to make sure that the catalog is highly available and that the catalog is stored in a durable location.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Move the catalog to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.

Redis can manage its durability using its AOF persistence which allows logging changes of the catalog data and can be replayed, even in the event of failure. As for the availability, Redis also allows replication, so if one fails, another is still working. Considering this question isn't about sharing file systems between instances and rather a customer wants to access a catalog, option A seems to be more suitable option here.
------------------------------
49] A company stores call transcript files on a monthly basis. Users access the files randomly within 1 year of the call, but users access the files infrequently after 1 year. The company wants to optimize its solution by giving users the ability to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year-old as quickly as possible. A delay in retrieving older files is acceptable.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

B. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select. 


S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of object size or retention period. You can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering as the default storage class for virtually any workload, especially data lakes, data analytics, new applications, and user-generated content.
------------------------------
50] A company has a production workload that runs on 1,000 Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The workload is powered by third-party software. The company needs to patch the third-party software on all EC2 instances as quickly as possible to remediate a critical security vulnerability.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

D. Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.

AWS Systems Manager Run Command allows the company to run commands or scripts on multiple EC2 instances. By using Run Command, the company can quickly and easily apply the patch to all 1,000 EC2 instances to remediate the security vulnerability.

Creating an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Lambda functions are not designed to run on EC2 instances. Configuring AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as Patch Manager is not designed to apply third-party software patches. Scheduling an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances would not be a suitable solution, as maintenance windows are not designed to apply patches to third-party software.
