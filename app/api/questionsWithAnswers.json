The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability.\r\nWhich solution meets these requirements?\r\n\r\nD. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.\r\n\r\nan SQS queue can handle a maximum of 3,000 messages per second. However, you can request higher throughput by contacting AWS Support. AWS can increase the message throughput for your queue beyond the default limits in increments of 300 messages per second, up to a maximum of 10,000 messages per second.\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that the maximum number of messages per second that a queue can handle is not the same as the maximum number of requests per second that the SQS API can handle. The SQS API is designed to handle a high volume of requests per second, so it can be used to send messages to your queue at a rate that exceeds the maximum message throughput of the queue.",

Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.\r\n\r\nCloudFront with Multiple Origins: CloudFront allows you to set up multiple origins for your distribution, so you can use both the ALB (for dynamic content) and the S3 bucket (for static content) as origins. This means that both your dynamic and static content can be served through CloudFront, which will cache content at edge locations to reduce latency.\r\nRoute 53 Integration with CloudFront: Amazon Route 53 can be easily configured to route traffic for your domain to a CloudFront distribution. Users will access your domain, and Route 53 will direct them to the nearest CloudFront edge location.",

The company needs to implement a repeatable process that works with native AWS services and follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework.\r\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?\r\n\r\nB. Attach the appropriate IAM role to each existing instance and new instance. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish a remote SSH session.\r\n\r\nWith AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, you can manage your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, edge devices, on-premises servers, and virtual machines (VMs). You can use either an interactive one-click browser-based shell or the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). It provides secure and auditable node management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.",

The company must decrease latency for users who access the website.\r\nWhich solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?\r\n\r\nC. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the CloudFront distribution\r\n\r\nAmazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that distributes content globally to reduce latency. By setting up a CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket hosting the static website, you can take advantage of its edge locations around the world to deliver content from the nearest location to the users, reducing the latency they experience.\r\n\r\nCloudFront automatically caches and replicates content to its edge locations, resulting in faster delivery and lower latency for users worldwide. This solution is highly effective in optimizing performance while keeping costs under control because CloudFront charges are based on actual data transfer and requests, and the pay-as-you-go pricing model ensures that you only pay for what you use.",

Create an IAM role in the company’s account to delegate access to the vendor’s IAM role. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the role for the permissions that the vendor requires.\r\n\r\nIAM roles allow you to delegate access to resources in your AWS account to another AWS account. In this case, you can create a role in your account and grant the vendor's IAM role permission to assume that role.\r\n\r\nBy doing this, the vendor can use temporary security credentials obtained by assuming the role to access resources in your account. This ensures that the vendor doesn't need IAM credentials from your account.",

(Choose two.)\r\n\r\nA. Ensure the root user uses a strong password.\r\nB. Enable multi-factor authentication to the root user.\r\n\r\nUsing a strong, complex password for the root user is a fundamental security practice. This helps protect the account from unauthorized access.\r\nEnabling MFA adds an additional layer of security. Even if someone manages to obtain the root user's password, they would still need the second factor (e.g., a mobile device or hardware token) to successfully authenticate.",

Create an AWS Lambda function for each S3 PUT event to invoke the ETL job.\r\n\r\nAWS Glue ETL Job:\r\n\r\nAWS Glue is a fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that can be used to convert data formats.\r\nBy creating an AWS Glue ETL job, you can offload the conversion process to a fully managed service, reducing operational overhead.\r\nAWS Lambda for S3 PUT Events:\r\nAWS Lambda can be configured to trigger on S3 PUT events. This ensures that the ETL job is invoked automatically each time a new .csv file is uploaded to the S3 bucket.\r\nThe Lambda function acts as a glue between the S3 events and the Glue ETL job.",

Configure the security group for the EC2 instances to only allow traffic that comes from the security group for the ALB.\r\n\r\nSecurity groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances. By configuring the security group for the EC2 instances to only allow traffic from the security group associated with the ALB, you can control and restrict inbound traffic effectively.\r\n\r\nWhen you specify a security group as the source in the inbound rules of another security group, you allow traffic only from instances that are members of that source security group. In this case, you can allow traffic only from the ALB, ensuring that traffic is restricted to the necessary source.",

Launch all EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone within the same AWS Region. Specify a placement group with cluster strategy when launching EC2 instances.\r\n\r\nA placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. The \"cluster\" strategy for placement groups places instances in close proximity to each other, providing low-latency, high-throughput communication between instances.\r\nBy launching all EC2 instances in the same Availability Zone within the same AWS Region, you minimize data transfer charges because data transfer within the same Availability Zone is not subject to additional costs.",

Enable AWS CloudTrail and use it for auditing. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS account activity, including actions taken through the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS SDKs and APIs. By enabling CloudTrail, the company can track user activity and changes to AWS resources, and monitor compliance with internal policies and external regulations.\r\n\r\nD. Enable AWS Config and create rules for auditing and compliance purposes. AWS Config provides a detailed inventory of the AWS resources in your account, and continuously records changes to the configurations of those resources. By creating rules in AWS Config, the company can automate the evaluation of resource configurations against desired state, and receive alerts when configurations drift from compliance.",

Create an IAM role for the deployment engineer to explicitly define the permissions specific to the AWS CloudFormation stack and launch stacks using that IAM role.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that the IAM user has the necessary permissions for AWS CloudFormation but not unnecessary permissions for other AWS services.\r\n\r\nIAM roles are more suitable for temporary elevated permissions needed during AWS CloudFormation stack operations.

Add an inbound rule to the security group of the database tier’s RDS instance to allow traffic from the web tiers security group.\r\n\r\nSecurity Groups: Security groups act as virtual firewalls for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.

ALB provides advanced routing capabilities and can handle the asynchronous API requirements.\r\n\r\nAWS App Mesh: AWS App Mesh can be used to scale the instances of the ECS cluster based on the SQS queue size. This allows for dynamic scaling based on demand, helping to efficiently use resources.",

Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to ingest the data. Process the data using AWS Lambda functions.\r\n\r\nKinesis Data Streams is designed for ingesting and processing real-time streaming data at scale. It can handle large volumes of data and provides the ability to scale horizontally.\r\n Using Lambda functions allows for serverless, event-driven processing of the data. Lambda automatically scales based on the number of incoming events, providing the needed elasticity to handle spikes in data volume without the need to manage underlying infrastructure.",

Applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances access the file shares. The company needs a storage disaster recovery (DR) solution in a secondary Region. The data that is replicated in the secondary Region needs to be accessed by using the same protocols as the primary Region.\r\n\r\nWhich solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?\r\n\r\nC. Create an FSx for ONTAP instance in the secondary Region. Use NetApp SnapMirror to replicate data from the primary Region to the secondary Region.\r\n\r\nFSx for ONTAP supports NetApp SnapMirror, which is a robust data replication technology. You can use SnapMirror to replicate data from the primary FSx for ONTAP instance in the primary Region to an FSx for ONTAP instance in the secondary Region.",
